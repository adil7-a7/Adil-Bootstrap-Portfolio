# Portfolio Website - Adil Seco

## Overview
As part of the weekly challenge of the Front-End Development Bootcamp I developed a website design for my portfolio using Bootstrap.


## User Acceptance Criteria
* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.


# User Interface Design
## Colors
I used a Gradient to give a cool and modern feel to the vistor of the website.

 Gradient Color 1:
 - #090744 

Gradient Color 2:
 - #a20070
